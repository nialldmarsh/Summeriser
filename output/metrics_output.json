    "HumanSummary": "This incident involved uploading multiple large receipt files into the Expense Claim Portal, causing repeated timeouts. The root cause was the server\u2019s restrictive file size limit.

This measure prevented further disruptions and streamlined the claims process for Finance.",

    "HumanSummary": "When Isla tried to gather cross-department expense insights, she discovered the dashboard\u2019s summary widgets were empty. Investigation revealed that a key aggregation script was unintentionally turned off during maintenance. After reactivating this script, the dashboard correctly displayed departmental spending data. The incident served as a reminder to label critical background tasks more clearly, ensuring that routine updates do not inadvertently disrupt essential reporting features.",
